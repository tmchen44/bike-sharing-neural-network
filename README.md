# Bike Sharing Neural Network
This project builds and trains a neural network that predicts the number of bike users on a given date.

## Getting Started
1. Install miniconda (link [here](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)).
2. Use miniconda to install the required Anaconda packages from `requirements.txt`.
3. Install Tensorflow 1.0 for Python (link [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)).
4. Run Jupyter Notebook and open `Your_first_neural_network.ipynb`.

## Project Overview

In this project, bike share data from the UCI machine learning repository is loaded and prepared for training, validating, and testing a neural network.

The network with its forward and backward passes is built from scratch using just the Numpy library.
